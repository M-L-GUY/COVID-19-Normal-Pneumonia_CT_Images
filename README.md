# COVID-19-Normal-Pneumonia_CT_Images
Prediction of normal, covid and pneumonia based on person Ct scan images
The aim of the model is to predict whether the person is suffering from COVID, PNEUMONAl. The model is build using following techniques:

1. TRANSFER LEARNING WITH ENSEMBLE LEARNING
2. Multilayer Percepton
3. Using pretrained Neural networks like RESNET, MOBILNET, INCEPTION,DENSENET
